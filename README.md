# Country Finder Website

### Introduction
In this blog post, we'll explore how to build a Country Finder application using React. This application allows users to search for countries, filter them by region, and view detailed information about each country. We will utilize React's hooks and context to manage state and theming, and we'll integrate with the REST Countries API to fetch country data.

### Project Overview
The Country Finder application provides an interactive interface where users can:
- Search for countries by name.
- Filter countries by region.
- View detailed information about each country, including its flag, population, and more.

### Features
- **Search Bar**: Allows users to search for countries by name.
- **Filter by Region**: Dropdown menu to filter countries based on their region.
- **Country Details**: Displays detailed information about a selected country.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes.

### Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
